Hi there ! My name is Alex Aquino, and I am a 4th year Graphic Communication student at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo ! 
I'm concentrating in UX/UI design, hoping to get a job in product design or UX research in the future.
This is my work for GRC 338 and 339, our Web Development and Content management courses.

Thanks for checking out my work !
