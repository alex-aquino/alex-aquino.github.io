Hi there ! My name is Alex Aquino, and I am a 4th year Graphic Communication student at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo ! 
I'm concentrating in UX/UI design, hoping to get a job in product design or design systems in the future.
This is my work for GRC 338, our Web Development and Content management course.

Thanks for checking out my work !
